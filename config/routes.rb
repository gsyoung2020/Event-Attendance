  # Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  #   Ensure you have overridden routes for generated controllers in your routes.rb.
  #   For example:

  #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
  #       devise_for :users, controllers: {
  #         sessions: 'users/sessions'
  #       }
  #     end
end
